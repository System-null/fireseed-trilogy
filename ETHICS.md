# Ethics and Intended Use

Fireseed Trilogy is an experiment in structuring personal life stories and value systems into a machine-readable format called a **capsule**.

This document defines the ethical boundaries and intended uses of this project.

---

## 1. What This Project Is For

- Helping individuals describe their life, decisions, and values in a **structured, auditable way**.
- Providing a format that future AI systems can parse without guessing – especially for:
  - Legacy / “digital will” use-cases.
  - Personal archives and reflection.
  - Research on human-AI alignment at the individual level.

The intent is to **empower individuals**, not to give institutions another opaque scoring system.

---

## 2. What This Project Is *Not* For

The project explicitly discourages and does not endorse:

- **Surveillance or profiling** of individuals without their informed consent.
- **Automated scoring, ranking, or blacklisting** of people using their capsules.
- **Coercive usage**, where people are forced to create capsules or disclose private information.
- Any use that violates basic human rights or applicable local laws.

If you are building a system that evaluates, filters, or punishes people using Fireseed capsules, you are outside of this project’s intended scope.

---

## 3. Ownership and Control

- Capsules are conceptually owned by the **person they describe**.
- Any platform or tool built on top of this project should:
  - Give individuals clear control over what is stored and shared.
  - Provide transparent explanations of how capsule data is used.
  - Offer ways to revoke or update outdated information where technically possible.

---

## 4. Transparency and Accountability

If you use this project in a product, research study, or institution:

- Be transparent with users about:
  - What data you collect.
  - How capsules are processed and stored.
  - What decisions (if any) are made using capsule data.
- Provide contact points for questions, corrections, or deletion requests where applicable.

---

## 5. Evolving Guidelines

These ethical guidelines are not exhaustive and may evolve as:

- The project matures.
- New use-cases and risks are discovered.
- Community members provide feedback.

If you have concerns about an unethical use-case involving this project, please open a discussion or reach out via the security/contact channels.
