## How to contribute
- Fork & PR to `main`. Keep PRs small and focused.
- Run CI locally if possible; attach context to failures.
## Coding
- Code: MIT. Docs/media: CC BY 4.0.
- Keep actions pinned; no `@main`.
## Commit & PR
- Conventional commits (feat|fix|chore|docs|test|ci|refactor).
- Describe *why* not just *what*.
