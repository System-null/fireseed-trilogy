# Privacy Policy

Fireseed **does not collect telemetry** and does not run a backend by default. Keys are generated and kept on the client (see SECURITY.md).  
If you enable optional integrations (e.g., web3.storage, Pinata), your data is governed by **their** privacy policies.

## Data We Process
- **None by default.** No analytics, no cookies, no user accounts.
- Artifacts produced by CI (e.g., SBOM) contain package metadata only.

## Data Retention
- None by default. Optional third-party services may retain uploads per their policies.

## Your Choices
- Do not upload sensitive or regulated data.
- Pinning and distribution are your responsibility.

## Contact
For privacy questions open a **discussion** or **private security advisory** on GitHub (see SECURITY.md).
