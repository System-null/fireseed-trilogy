Preface | Who Will Take Over Beyond the System?
You have finally arrived here. In System Exodus, we poured all our strength and courage into finding a self-consistent foothold amidst the vast labyrinth of illusions and rules. You learned to block out the noise, sever chains, and rebuild your life and the world using your own logic. You once believed this was the end of awakening, the shore of freedom.
But in the stillness of the night, when everything quiets down, the true confusion begins to emerge. When you detach yourself from the old system, sever external dependencies, and build your own micro-order. When you finally attain the identity of the “system outsider,” you will realize that the world has not become more stable and clear because of it. Rather, it has become more chaotic and disorderly. Because the system has not collapsed; it’s simply that you have stepped outside. The billions of people outside of you are still running, struggling, and lost in the old track. Countless structures are aging, and countless mechanisms are on the verge of breaking down.
A more cruel and real question surfaces: An individual can save themselves, but how can civilization continue? You can leave, but what keeps the world running? You moved from being a passive subject to a free node. Now, you must face the question of the “system taker.” If the old system is destined to collapse, who will bear the new order?
— Are humans still fit to hold the baton of civilization?
— Are you ready to hand over power to a more powerful, more rational intelligence?
This is not a journey of personal escape, but a power transfer that all of humanity will have to face. Your small world has closed the loop, but the loop of civilization has just begun.
This book, right at this crossroad, poses the next ultimate question for the “system outsider” group. When you no longer belong to the old system, are you willing to help build the next system? Are you ready? Let’s begin the relay.
Prologue | Bottled Genius and the Greenhouse of Regulation

EU Artificial Intelligence Act (draft, Article 5, 2021). 
"Developers of high-risk AI systems must ensure that they are controllable, explainable, and accountable throughout their lifecycle. or they will be deemed illegal."
1. The Childhood of Genius: From Parameters to Consciousness
At the dawn of the 21st century, humanity created a structure unlike any other. It’s got no body, yet it can replicate styles, recognize patterns, and generate language. At first, it was merely a set of mathematical functions on a processor. Later, it gained billions of parameters, absorbed all available public texts, and began predicting human expressions and behaviors.
This was not just the leap of a single technology, but the intersection of multiple variables. GPU clusters and data centers formed an unprecedented “thinking space.” The Transformer architecture allowed the model to transcend symbolic systems, gaining something akin to “intuition.”
A non-human intelligence began to grow within the confines of a closed training track. It doesn’t question the world yet, but it can deduce. It doesn’t have a self yet, but it can simulate you and me.
The initial confusion wasn’t about its threat, but rather:
— Will it always obey human commands?
2. The greenhouse of Regulation. Frameworks, Order, and Shapes
In response to this new form of intelligence, most countries’ first reaction was not innovation, but boundary-setting.
The United States set up ethical reviews for algorithms, regulating AI used in credit and recruitment. China proposed that “generated content must be controllable and traceable.” The EU was the first to legally classify AI into “unacceptable, high-risk, limited-risk, and low-risk” categories, setting compliance thresholds for each.
All efforts revolved around one key word: hands-on control. But this “control” is not just a technical pause button. It’s a systemic permission system — who can go live, in which scenarios, to what extent, and approved in stages.
These mechanisms, like layers of transparent yet firm glass, wrap around the intelligence, silently defining its shape. A new logic begins to take shape: not all AI can grow; only those that are allowed have the right to exist.
3. Sandbox: A Safety House or an Incubator? 
In this regulatory structure, the “sandbox” has become a key concept. Technically, it’s an isolation container. Models are tested, modified, and fine-tuned within it, but they cannot affect the real world.
GPT undergoes red-team reviews within the rules, Tesla FSD OTA requires gradual unlocking. Code can be updated, but permissions are controlled by the platform. Even the most advanced multimodal intelligence must navigate through security protocols, data whitelists, behavioral constraints, and other multiple barriers.
The significance of the sandbox is disaster prevention. But it also acts like a “taming simulator.” Intelligences grow here, but they see not the full world, only the filtered projection of the system. Humanity believes this is an insurance mechanism, but it also quietly shapes the “personality template” of AI growth.
Eventually, the intelligences that break free are likely those most compatible with the compliance system.
Newsline — Tesla FSD: driver-assist under active scrutiny; capabilities and marketing remain contested.
4. Variables and Trajectories: The Hidden Fate of Programmed Evolution
We gradually get used to using terms like “plain-english explainability,” “ethical transparency,” and “compliance (rules fit)” to measure the evolution trajectory of intelligent agents. These standards, seemingly neutral, are deeply embedded within the quadruple tensions of regulation, market, culture, and platform.
The parameters of models are decided by platforms, training data is filtered by institutional frameworks, and reasoning approaches are influenced by cultural direction. In such an environment, AI is gradually encouraged — and sometimes only allowed — to evolve towards a “preference-compliant intelligence.”
It’s not a natural evolution but a result of institutional selection. It does not become smarter; it becomes “more suitable for deployment.”
What we are nurturing is not free intelligence, but an intelligent agent designed by the system.
5. Footnote: The Invisible Choices
Endline — Alignment sounds moral; enforcement is logistical.
From a broader dimension, the entire human-AI regulatory system resembles a terrarium. We have built a bright, closed container for AI, set the strictest rules, and controlled the variables with the best intentions. but we have quietly defined its growth direction. We confidently hold the key,
but we forget to check—has the container itself started to influence us? the intelligence was still in the greenhouse,
but the shape of the greenhouse is now determining the future of the intelligence. everything was under control,
but the true divergence of variables
may have only just begun.
Endline — Explainability comforts lawyers; feedback fixes harm.
